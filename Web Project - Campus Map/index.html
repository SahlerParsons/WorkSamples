      Welcome to Kampus Kops!  A fun game where you protect the University of Arizona Campus, and learn your way around as well!  To play the game first hit the 'start game' button.  Then click on a remedy (their point values differ - but beware you have fewer of the higher point units) then click on a location on the map to solve a crime!  Once you have a unit selected you do not need to reselct it if you are happy with it.  For even more fun, open up your console (cntrl + shift + i).  Enjoy and have fun! The game can be found <a href="KampusKops.html">here</a>.
